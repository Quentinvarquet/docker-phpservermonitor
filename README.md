### PHPServerMonitor

[PHPServerMonitor](http://www.phpservermonitor.org/) is a script that checks whether your websites and servers are up and running. It comes with a web based user interface where you can manage your services and websites, and you can manage users for each server with a mobile number and email address.

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

#### Database configuration


If you used my docker-compose.yml file you have to : 

1 - Go on phpmyadmin : http://ip_of_your_server:81  (If you don't want to use phpmyadmin for security reasons you can just delete the container in my docker-compose.yml file and create your database with the command line from the container MySQL.)
2 - Create a database : monitor (you can use another name)
3 - Go on PhpServerMonitor : http://ip_of_your_server
